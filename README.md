This was developed as part of a homework received during the `Advanced Data Structures` course that I'm currently taking.

# About

`Dataviz` is inspired by [this website](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BTree.html), developed by Associate Professor David Galles from the University of San Francisco. My goal was to create a tool with similar functionality, but with a more modern look and feel.

# Usage

## Online (recommended)

This tool is available online on my website, [dataviz.zyphenvisuals.com](https://dataviz.zyphenvisuals.com).

## Local

The following section was kept from the `create-vue` scaffolding `README.md`.

### Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

### Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

### Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).

### Project Setup

```sh
pnpm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
pnpm dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
pnpm build
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
pnpm lint
```
